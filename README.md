# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

In this challenge, I was provided a dataset to preprocess and clean in order to be ran through a deep learning model that Deliverable 1 and 2 had me create. The intended accuracy of this model was below 75%. The purpose of this analysis is to practice processing data for machine learning as well as practice creating neural networks and machine learning models. In deliverable 3, I was instructed to make three attempts at optimizing the previously created model and increase the accuracy to above 75%. I was also working to determine the following:

### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
