# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

In this challenge, I was provided a dataset to preprocess and clean in order to be ran through a deep learning model that Deliverable 1 and 2 had me create. The intended accuracy of this model was below 75%. The purpose of this analysis is to practice processing data for machine learning as well as practice creating neural networks and machine learning models. In deliverable 3, I was instructed to make three attempts at optimizing the previously created model and increase the accuracy to above 75%. I was also working to answer the following questions:

### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for the model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for the model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions were selected for the neural network model, and why?
- Was the target model performance achieved?
- What steps were taken take to try and increase model performance?


## Results: 
The analysis performed found that:

### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for the model?
The variable that was considered the target for my model was the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column.
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for the model?
The "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", AND "ASK_AMT" columns were used as the features for the model.

The image above shows the code used to create the features and target variables for the model.

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions were selected for the neural network model, and why?
- Was the target model performance achieved?
- What steps were taken take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
